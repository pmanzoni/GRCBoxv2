GRCBoxv2: Version 2 (Fork) of the GrcBox (Extending Smartphone Connectivity in Vehicular Networks)

The GRCBox offers an architecture that extends the in-vehicle connectivity by providing both inter- and intra-vehicular communication support.

Using GRCBox each application can choose the interface for its data flows, which increases flexibility and will allow developers to easily implement applications based on ad-hoc connectivity, such as VDTN applications.
